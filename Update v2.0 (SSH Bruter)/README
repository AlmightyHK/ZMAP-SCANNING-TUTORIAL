- This version of update has the ability to bruteforce ssh on multiple ports.
- Very fast
- 100s of default username:password combos hardcoded into the script, no need for password file.
- Simply scan a range of ips on any known SSH port using zmap or some other port scanner, directing the output of the scan to mfu.txt
- ./update <SSH PORT> <Max Forks>
- Done

- Make sure you change the permissions to the file also: chmod +x update
